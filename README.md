# ts-mongo

- This is basic typescript + mongoDb api creation project.
- Here I am creating apis like insert and list of books.
- init project
- install ts and normal js packages.
- ======"build" folder is "outDir" folder in tsconfig.json
- ======="build" folder contains all .js file after compile .ts files.
- Once you compile project using,
    - npx tsc
    - npm run dev (for this have to write script in package.json)


- Programmatically difference between ts and js

1) import package

- .ts 
    - import express from 'express';
- .js
    - const express = require('express')
